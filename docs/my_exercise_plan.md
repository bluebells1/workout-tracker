# Perimenopausal Exercise Plan

## Overview
This plan combines hormonal health priorities (resistance training, plyometrics) with targeted mobility work to address postural issues and glute activation. The home routines alternate focus areas while the gym sessions provide progressive overload for bone density and muscle preservation.

## PROGRESSION & MODIFICATIONS

### Home Routine Progressions
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on form, use bodyweight or light resistance
- **Week 3-4**: Increase reps or hold times by 20%
- **Week 5+**: Add resistance, increase complexity, or add second round

### Gym Routine Progressions
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on form, moderate weights (70% of previous max)
- **Week 3-4**: Increase weight by 5-10%
- **Week 5-8**: Continue progressive overload, add complexity

### Pain Management Modifications
- **Neck/trap pain flare**: Skip overhead movements, add extra stretching
- **Hamstring/knee pain**: Reduce range of motion, focus on glute activation
- **General fatigue**: Choose Routine A or light gym session

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Prioritize form over weight/speed**
2. **Listen to your body** - adapt routines based on energy and pain levels
3. **Consistency over intensity** - better to do 10 minutes daily than skip days
4. **Progressive overload** in gym sessions for bone density benefits
5. **Address weaknesses** - extra glute work if hamstrings/knees acting up
