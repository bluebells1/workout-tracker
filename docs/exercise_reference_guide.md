## FORM CUES & SAFETY TIPS

### For Neck/Upper Trap Issues
- **Avoid**: Shrugging shoulders during overhead movements
- **Focus**: Keep shoulders down and back, lengthen neck
- **Cue**: "Proud chest, long neck"

### For Hamstring/Knee Issues
- **Focus**: Glute activation before any lower body work
- **Cue**: "Push the ground away" during squats/lunges
- **Modify**: Reduce range of motion if pain occurs

### General Safety
- **Warm up thoroughly** before heavy lifting
- **Progress gradually** - add 2.5-5lbs per week for upper body, 5-10lbs for lower body
- **Stop if sharp pain** occurs during any movement
- **Breathe**: Exhale during exertion phase, inhale during lowering phase

### Equipment Substitutions
- **No kettlebell**: Use dumbbell or backpack with books
- **No resistance band**: Use towel for some exercises
- **No pull-up bar**: Use doorway pull-up bar or gym lat pulldown

## TARGETING YOUR SPECIFIC ISSUES

### For Better Glute Activation
1. Always do glute bridges or clamshells before squats/lunges
2. Focus on "pushing the ground away" rather than "lifting up"
3. Squeeze glutes at top of every bridge/thrust movement

### For Neck/Upper Trap Relief
1. Perform upper trap stretches multiple times daily
2. Strengthen lower traps with face pulls and wall slides
3. Check posture regularly throughout the day

### For Perimenopausal Benefits
1. **Heavy lifting days**: Focus on compound movements with challenging weights
2. **Plyometric days**: Include explosive movements for bone density
3. **Consistency**: Aim for resistance training at least 4-5 days per week total
